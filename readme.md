# ColorPick App

I created this simple tool to help designers and developers find unique colors and striking gradient combinations. By making a tool that solely generates random colors and gradients, colors are found that would otherwise be unthought of. I hope ColorSpark becomes a useful tool in your toolkit to help spark new ideas for your next design project.
